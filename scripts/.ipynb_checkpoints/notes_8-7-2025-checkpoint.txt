Consider using rat flatmap for interactivity on UMAP

We can click certain regions of the flatmap and color-code points accordingly in the visualization.

Also, if you pick regions, could you display the relevant vector?

input vs output analysis is of interest. Directionality is important (what info comes in vs out). 

Add in an option to choose which subregions in the hippocampus we care about. More important for outputs but do it for both.



Are there are a handful of hypotheses to hone in on?
- seperate into dorsal, ventral, and both


Toss these in for both efferents and afferents
ventral (CA1v and SUBv)
dorsal (CA1d and SUBd) 
CA3 and DG 
CA1 and SB
CA3 and just CA1


Invest more time to think about how to udnerstand the data before moving to comparing things, 

Parallel circos to whatever 

Preferred clustering algorithm? Loovaign (luvaign) = modularity maximation. 

brain connectivity toolbox, is in louvaign method (olaf sporns made this)


1. cluster
2. determine how many
3 visualize it
4. then project the hypotheses into that space
